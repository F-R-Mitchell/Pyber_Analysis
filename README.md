# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The work assignment for the new position is to create visualizations of rideshare data. I will create visualizations of data using Matplotlib to import access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Matplotlib is a graphing library within Python that is very useful for analyzing data due to its robust visualization features.

## Results

As seen within the image, the fare per city type is ranked urban, suburban, and rural. The main possible reason is a higher population density in urban cities could result in a higher ride count, a higher driver count, and a higher percentage of fares. as seen in: 


As seen in:

![Fig6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/135781016-6d4a673a-b844-4f37-8e50-720038751c7a.png)

The percentage of rides in an urban city is about 2/3's while suburban and rural cities account for just 1/3. More rides equate to a higher volume of fares thus adding to the credibility of the "Total Fare by City Type" graph.

Another result is a higher driver count. Since there are more riders, there needs to be more drivers in order to fulfill the larger demand in an urban city as seen in:

![Fig7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/135781382-1e097ac2-29bb-4edd-9c98-c532d7c2de62.png)

About 80% of the total drivers are in an urban city while about 20% are drivers in suburban cities.

Another possible reason is the higher percentage of fares for urban cities which both of the previous results tie into. More rides fulfilled by more drivers account for more fares thus causing urban cities to accumulate more fares. As seen in the graph below:

Urban cities account for about 2/3's of the total fares between the three city types.

## Summary

The three business recommendations I would provide to the CEO are:

1. Possibly encourage more people to become drivers within rural and suburban cities. As seen in the graphs above the proportion of suburban and urban drivers is less than the proportion of rides within each city type. This could mean that rides aren't being fulfilled or riders are not opting to use rideshare possibly due to large wait times.
2. The company could provide discounts for riders within rural and suburban city types. As seen in the graphs above the proportion of rides is less than the proportion of fares for suburban and rural city types. This could be the result of a higher fare due to there being fewer drivers available in rural and suburban cities.
3. Create a higher presence within suburban and rural cities. The disparity between the city types could be due to residents not knowing about ridesharing apps.
